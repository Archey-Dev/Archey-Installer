# Archey Installer

A beginner-friendly Arch Linux installer with optional learning explanations.

## What is this?

Archey Installer is a custom Arch Linux installation framework designed to:

- Simplify the Arch install process
- Offer optional explanations for learning
- Allow desktop environment selection (KDE, GNOME, i3, etc.)
- Support multiple users
- Provide a cleaner experience than raw archinstall

This is NOT a preconfigured distro.
It is still Arch. You are still in control.

## Why?

Arch is powerful, but the manual install can be overwhelming.
This project keeps the power but removes unnecessary friction.
